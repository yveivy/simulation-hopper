## Game Story

Our protagonist, Barf, is an outcast from a distant corner of the universe. His home planet is dying, with plants wilting away and oxygen levels plummeting. Armed with nothing but a fragmented ship and a scribbled map, Barf embarks on a mission to save his world. Along the way, he navigates the complexities of interplanetary trade, interacts with diverse characters, and grapples with his own limitations. His heroic journey is fraught with humor, heart, and a fair share of unexpected mishaps (including a rather unfortunate loss of pants).
