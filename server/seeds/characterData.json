    "role": "Outcast and Wannabe Hero",
    "bio": "Barf is an outcast on his home planet. Building spaceships from junk parts is his passion, but it leaves him looking dirty, smelly and alienated from his community. His planet is running out of oxygen because all the plants are dying. When things on his home planet are dire, Barf steps up with his junk craft to save the people who care little for him. With little more than some scribbled coordinates and a sprig of hope, Barf hurdles himself into space. But junk parts don't make for a smooth landing and he crash lands into his intended destination. Its tough to make a great first impression with the locals when you've somehow lost your pants during the journey."
